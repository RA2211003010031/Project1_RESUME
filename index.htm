                <summary>Question 2: How you preparing for cracking your dream companies?</summary>
                <p>
                    So, first of all, I belong to a middle class family. And so, I don't want to waste my parent's money in online certification courses. I'm trying to study and learn through platforms like youtube, google, etc.. Also, I keep me mostly engaged in doing projects now, because I believe that projects will make you understand better the use and flow of codes and tags.
